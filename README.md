Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, a classic river-crossing puzzle often used in artificial intelligence and algorithmic studies.

Problem Description
The Missionaries and Cannibals problem involves a group of missionaries and cannibals on one side of a river. They need to cross the river using a boat that can only carry a limited number of passengers. The challenge is to find a sequence of moves that allows the missionaries to cross the river without being outnumbered by the cannibals on either side.
